          <p>This website was inspired by a coding challenge. The original challenge was to try and write a code that would accept a number or word and check to see if it was a palindrome. But once that was done I was left wondering, "just how many english words are palindromes anyways?"</p>
          <br>
          <p>This website was the offshoot of that idea but it would not have been possible without the list of words from the <a href="https://github.com/atebits/Words">letterpress</a> word list. Check it out.</p>
